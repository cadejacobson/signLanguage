# signLanguage
My attempt at building a free online software for learning sign language. :)

I have learned sign language off and on for the last 5 years. I am by no means an expert, but
believe that it's an important skill that everyone should learn. However, I have found
few **free** resources that look good and teach effective sign language. For this reason, I am 
creating my app. Please check it out!
